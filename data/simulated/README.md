\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Simulated Data\
\
This folder contains simulated genomic datasets generated to evaluate the performance of robust and non-robust genomic prediction and heritability estimation methods presented in the paper:\
\
**Robust Genomic Prediction and Heritability Estimation using Density Power Divergence**  \
Crop Science (2024)\
\
The simulated data are generated dynamically using scripts provided in the `simulation/` directory and are **not stored explicitly** to reduce repository size and ensure full reproducibility.\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Simulation Design\
\
The simulations are designed to mimic genomic prediction experiments under realistic breeding trial settings, including:\
\
- SNP genotype data generated using `AlphaSimR`\
- Randomized complete block and alpha-lattice designs\
- Two replications per genotype\
- Prespecified heritability (H\'b2 = 0.7)\

\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56810  Contamination Scenarios\
\
The simulation script supports multiple data-generating scenarios:\
\
1. **No contamination**  \
   Clean data without outliers\
\
2. **Response contamination**  \
   A fixed proportion of phenotypic responses are contaminated with large errors\
\
3. **Block contamination**  \
   Entire experimental blocks are contaminated to mimic field-level outliers\
\
These scenarios are used to assess robustness of one-stage and two-stage methods.\

\
## \uc0\u9881 \u65039  How the Data Are Generated\
\
All simulated datasets are generated by running:\
\
```r\
source("simulation/simulation_with_contamination.R")}
